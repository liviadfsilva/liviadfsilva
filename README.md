# 👋🏻 Hi, there!

I'm Lily, a software developer passionate about designing and building backend systems.

# 🌙 About Me

Thoroughout my developer journey, I've built projects focused on real-world scenarios combining modern frameworks and technologies to build efficient, scalable APIs.

In addition to that, having a background in psychoanalysis has strengthened my analytical thinking and helped me approach complex systems with a curiosity to both learn and better understand their underlying patterns.
