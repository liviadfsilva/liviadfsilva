# 🌙 About Me

Throughout my developer journey, I've created projects focused on real-world scenarios, combining modern frameworks and technologies to build efficient, scalable APIs.

Having a background in psychoanalysis has helped me strengthen my analytical thinking and approach complex systems with a curiosity to both learn and better understand things.

Some of my favourite things are books, cats, and yoga.
